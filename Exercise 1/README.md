# Exercise 1 - Chatter Bot

**Chatter Bot** is the first assignment I completed in the *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming* course at the HUJI.

In this exercise, I implemented a simple chatbot in **Java**, designed to mimic basic conversational behavior.  
The goal was to get familiar with Java syntax, basic OOP principles, and working with standard input/output.

To run the chatbot locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the src folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Exercise 1/src
   ```

3. Compile the project using **JDK 11**:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

4. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   java ChatterBot
